Day1
Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, is the practice of legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization’s defenses.

Key Points:
Purpose: To identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers (black-hat hackers) can exploit them.

Permission-based: Ethical hackers always have permission from the organization they are testing.

Techniques used: Similar to those of malicious hackers, including:

Scanning networks for open ports

Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or configurations

Phishing simulations

Social engineering tests

Types of Ethical Hackers:
White-hat hackers: Work with organizations to improve security.

Gray-hat hackers: Operate in a legal gray area—may hack without permission but usually don’t have malicious intent.

Common Areas Tested:
Network infrastructure

Web applications

Wireless networks

Employee awareness (via social engineering)

Physical security (sometimes)

Certifications for Ethical Hackers:
CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)

OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)

CompTIA PenTest+
